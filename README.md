Project Title: Spotify Clone (Frontend)

Welcome to the Spotify Clone (Frontend) project! This is a simple web application that replicates the user interface of Spotify using only HTML and CSS for the frontend. While it doesn't have the full functionality of the actual Spotify app (like playing music), it serves as a great learning resource for frontend web development and UI design.


Features:

Responsive Design:  The application is designed to work seamlessly on various screen sizes, from desktop to mobile devices.

Navigation:  Mimics Spotify's navigation with a sidebar for playlists, a search bar, and user profile section.

Playlist Display:  Lists sample playlists with cover images, titles, and descriptions.

Music Player:  Although it doesn't play music, it includes a static music player UI element with play, pause, and skip controls.

Styling:  Utilizes CSS to recreate Spotify's sleek and modern aesthetic, including color schemes and fonts.


Getting Started:

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser to view the Spotify clone.


Usage:

Feel free to explore the project's HTML and CSS files to understand how the Spotify UI is recreated. You can use this project as a starting point to learn or practice frontend web development techniques and CSS styling.
